## 🔧 Technology Stack Transition

### From (PHP/MySQL):
```
PHP 7.x + MySQL 5.7
Bootstrap 3 + jQuery
Session-based auth
Procedural + some OOP
```

```
React 18 + Next.js 14
Node.js 18+ + Express
PostgreSQL + Prisma
JWT/OAuth2 auth
TypeScript + Modern JS
```

## 🚦 5-Phase Migration Plan

### Phase 0: Foundation (2 weeks)
```bash
✓ Set up dev environment
✓ Configure CI/CD
✓ Create test data
✓ Set up monitoring
```

### Phase 1: Read-Only Clone (1 month)
```bash
✓ React app shell
✓ Authentication
✓ Read-only views
✓ Database sync
```

### Phase 2: Dual-Write (2 months)
```bash
✓ Write operations
✓ Data consistency
✓ Feature flags
✓ Beta testing (5%)
```

### Phase 3: Progressive (3 months)
```bash
Week 1-2: Auth & profiles
Week 3-4: Exercises
Week 5-6: Interactions
Week 7-8: Forum
Week 9-10: Payments
Week 11-12: Analytics
```

### Phase 4: Cutover (1 month)
```bash
✓ 100% traffic switch
✓ Legacy standby
✓ Performance tune
✓ User feedback
```

## 🛡️ Critical Safety Measures

### Instant Rollback (<5 min)
```bash
./scripts/switch-to-legacy.sh
./scripts/verify-traffic.sh
./scripts/health-check.sh
```

### Daily Validations
```bash
npm run validate:all
npm run sync:check
npm run backup:create
```
