4. Set up video upload and streaming infrastructure

### Phase 2: Assessment & Professional Development
1. Implement EGRA assessment system
2. Build professional development modules
3. Add certificate generation
4. Create formal assessment framework

### Phase 3: Mobile & Offline Support
1. Develop React Native app
2. Implement offline content download
3. Build sync mechanisms
4. Add push notifications

### Phase 4: Enhanced Features
1. Integrate dictionary
2. Add audio/TTS support
3. Implement QR authentication
4. Optimize for performance

## 6. Technical Debt & Considerations

1. **Database**: Currently using MySQL, but schema shows no video/blob storage strategy
2. **Mock Data**: Subjects and lessons using mock data instead of database
3. **File Storage**: No implementation for video/document storage (need CDN/S3)
4. **Real-time**: Socket.io implemented but underutilized
5. **Testing**: No evidence of test coverage for new features

---

## 7. Conclusion

The current implementation covers basic educational functionality but lacks critical features for a modern learning platform. The highest priorities should be:

1. Video content management (completely missing)
2. Adding missing subjects (CALM, Social Studies)
3. Digital library for resources
4. Professional development system
5. Mobile app with offline support

The platform has a solid foundation with user management, basic exercises, and payment integration, but needs significant development to achieve feature parity with the production PLP platform.
